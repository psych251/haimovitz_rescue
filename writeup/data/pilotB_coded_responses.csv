1,"Well, you didn't do very well on this test, but you can study more for the next test and improve your score. Speak with your teacher and ask them about the material and what you should work on to do better. We will study together prior to the next test and I know that you will do much better. Don't worry too much about this. It is only one test.","I would think that my child studied, but did not study the material that was on the test sufficiently.","I would not be concerned. I was a straight A student, but even I failed tests once in a while.",Enhancing,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,2,1,0,0,0,0,1,4
2,"I would ask my child why they think they got the grade and if they actually took the time to study. If they had studied, then I will tell them to go back through the material and figure out what went wrong. It is important to understand why something happened to be able to not repeat the same mistakes and to learn. Thatâ€™s more important than grades even through grades do hold weight. ",I would think that maybe my child was distracted or did not fully understand the materials.,"I would feel like it was my responsibility to help my child understand who was at fault. I would not feel differently about my child, but I would feel frustrated. However I would make sure to show love and respect when correcting them.",Debilitating,0,0,0,1,0,0,2,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,4
